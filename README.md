# **🔬 Stress-Strain Analysis Using Python & Excel**  

### **📌 Project Overview**  
This Python-based tool automates **stress-strain analysis** from compression test data stored in Excel. It efficiently processes **large datasets (including 14,407+ data points or more)**, calculates key mechanical properties, and embeds a **stress-strain curve** directly into the Excel sheet.  

### **⚙️ Features & Workflow**  
✅ **Scalable Data Processing**  
- Reads and processes **any amount of data** from an Excel file using `openpyxl`.  
- Automatically detects and extracts key parameters: **Force, Stroke, Thickness, Width, and Length**.  

✅ **Stress-Strain & Mechanical Property Calculations**  
**Stress (σ)** = Force / (Length × Width)

**Strain (ε)**= (Stroke / Thickness) × 100
- **Maximum Stress (σc):** Identifies the peak stress value.  
- **Compression Modulus (Ec):** Uses linear regression for stiffness estimation.  
- **Energy Absorption (E0.x):** Computes the area under the stress-strain curve using **Simpson’s rule**.  

✅ **Visualization**  
- Generates a **Stress-Strain Curve** using `matplotlib`.  
- Saves and embeds the plot directly into the Excel sheet.  

### **🛠 Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (`openpyxl`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`)  
- **Excel** for structured data storage  
- **Data Visualization** for insights  

### **🚀 Usage**  
1️⃣ Place your **Excel data file** in the project directory.  
2️⃣ Run the script to process the data.  
3️⃣ The script will save **stress, strain, and other properties** back into the Excel file.  
4️⃣ A **stress-strain curve** will be generated and embedded into the sheet.  

### **📂 Installation & Setup**  
```bash
pip install openpyxl numpy scipy matplotlib
```
Run the script:  
```bash
python stress_strain_analysis.py
```

### **📊 Results & Impact**  
🔹 Processes **any dataset size** efficiently—no limit on data points.  
🔹 Automates stress-strain analysis, reducing manual work.  
🔹 Provides **accurate material property evaluations** for engineering applications.
